          <p>
            I have written nearly 100 scripts to manage and monitor Linux based
            services. I use VIM as my primary editor for shell scripts.

          <p>
            A very versatile language that anyone can learn. It is the
            foundation of these very slides.

          <h2>CSS 3</h2>
          <p>
            A powerful styling language, sometimes difficult to understand, but
            satisfying once you master the syntax.
          </p>

        <div class="swiper-slide" style="background-image: url(./img/sass.png)">
          <h2>SASS</h2>
          <p>
            SASS is CSS on steroids. Mastering this syntax is a worthy goal, as
            it really does supercharge your styling.

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            I have slowly come to grips with how js works, and the amazing
            things it can allow you to do on a website, especially when used
            with Node.js or React.

          <h2>json</h2>
          <p>
            What an awesome notation language, much easier to understand and
            write than XML. You still have to be aware of your syntax tho.

          <h2>Python</h2>
          <p>
            This was the second programming language that I learned. It was
            daunting at first, but is very rewarding now that I have mastered
            it.

          <p>
            One of my Python projects had me create a blog using Django. This is
            a captivating web framework.

          <h2>Node.js</h2>
          <p>
            Still trying to master this language and syntax. I am slowly coming
            to understand this language better, and hope to master it in 2021.

          <p>
            This is by far the best editor I have found to work with all the
            languages that I currently work with. This is my go to editor!

        <div class="swiper-slide" style="background-image: url(./img/atom.png)">
          <h2>Atom</h2>
          <p>
            I began using Atom to code Python, and it was very good with that
            language, but for one reason or another Atom got very slow to load,
            so I switched to VSCode.

        <div class="swiper-slide" style="background-image: url(./img/vim.png)">
          <h2>VIM</h2>
          <p>
            If you work on Linux systems sooner or later you learn how to use
            VIM, and use it effectively. This is the ultimate command line
            editor.

          <h2>Sublime Text</h2>
          <p>
            When I first started coding html I used Sublime Text. Emmet is a
            godsend. I don't use it much anymore since VScode is my editor of
            choice.

          <h2>NotePad ++</h2>
          <p>
            For years I worked in TextPad, and then a friend showed me Notepad++
            and I haven't looked back. From reading log, XML, or even json this
            editor does it all.

        <div class="swiper-slide" style="background-image: url(./img/git.png)">
          <h2>Git</h2>
          <p>
            This is my now my favorite version control system. It is much easier
            to understand and use than Subversion, and it integrates so well
            with github.
          </p>

          <h2>Github</h2>
          <p>
            I opened my github account in 2020, and have been using it ever
            since, this allows me to move machines without having to worry if
            I'm working on the right code.

          <h2>Subversion</h2>
          <p>
            I have worked with svn for about 10 years now. It is a robust
            command line driven version control system.
